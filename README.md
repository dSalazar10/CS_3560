Intro to systems programming

The example programs found here were intended to only work on the Mac OS system as I use a lot of Mac only libraries.
For example, I use the FreeBSD C Library's sys/queue.h.
The HW assingments are intended to be cross platform (POSIX standards only).
These programs are just my experimentation, so use at your own risk. I do not test for errors in many places.
